Ai-Hero
=================

The goal of Ai-Hero is to create programmable money that is usable by everyone in the world.
We believe this is a civilization-changing technology that will dramatically increase human flourishing, freedom, and prosperity.
The project aims to achieve this goal by implementing a series of optimizations and protocol upgrades to enable programmable money to scale many orders of magnitude beyond current limits.
